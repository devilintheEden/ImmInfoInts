Complete: 

1. Column Number Change - 1 or 2 or 3, each column have 3 AIOs at a time.
2. Interaction Type Change - Menu / Swipe / Place.

To-Do: 

There is no specific information to populate the AIOs, so every AIO is identical. Thus the action of either put it in Saved or Deleted is the same - old AIO disappear, new one being pushed in. 

1. After populating the AIOs with unique information, users can reveal what information they put in each category by clicking on the Saved Items / Deleted Items icons (the same icon as used in the Place Interaction Type), and there will be a drop down menu.

2. Once the AIOs have its real content, the order of the info should be determined, especially when there is multiple columns. Here are some possible sequence.
